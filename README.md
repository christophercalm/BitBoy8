# BitBoy8

![Alt text](screenshot.JPG?raw=true "Title")


A chip8 emulator I wrote as a first large project in C and an introduction to 8 bit computers. It has not been tested on every rom but should work with most chip8 binaries. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

-[SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)

-C compiler

### Installing

I used Visual Studio 2019 to run the project but I will include the binary if you just want to run it. 

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* If there is a second argument it will turn debug mode on
```
bitboy8.exe romfile.rom debug
```
